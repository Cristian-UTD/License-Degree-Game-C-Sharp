# License Degree Game made in C# and Godot Engine

Made a little game using Godot Engine and C# for my license degree at university Facultatea de Științe Exacte Aurel Vlaicu.
The game have joke name "Virtual Spoder" is 2D platformer game where the player is a virutal spider that have to eat and collect bugs from digital world for going to next level. The game is short having only one tutorial and 2 levels, after player finish all levels, the game congratulate the player finish the game.

The codes are mostly in the assests and user_interface, every code have comments (in Romania) explaining what line of code doing. The codes can be more efficiently, but it's my first time that I made a game, but still feel proud how it is, also there's a lot of improvement to this game in the future.
